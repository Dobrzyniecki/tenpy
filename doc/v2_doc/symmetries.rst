Symmetries in tenpy
===================


TODO quick summary, references, overview over the article

We need a sound strategy to balance on the one side readability for non-experts and the other hand
making statements that are correct and reasonably general (i.e. hold for symmetry groups and for anyons).
One idea might be to put the rigorous version in a collapsible box ``.. collapse :: ``?
Or maybe have parallel articles, one accessible and one rigorous?
