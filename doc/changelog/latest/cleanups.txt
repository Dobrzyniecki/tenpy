- :issue:`443` document default model coupling parameters explicitly in docstrings
- Allow `None` value in :option:`Sweep.chi_list` which is to be replaced by ``trunc_params['chi_max']`` at class initialization.
- Handle SIGINT singal during simulation runs to continue until next algorithm checkpoint, save and then exit "gracefully" by raising KeyboardInterrupt.
  See :meth:`~tenpy.simulations.Simulation.handle_abort_signal`.

- go back to original dir after finishing a simulation (end of context manager) such that relative 'directory' options work as expected when repeatedly running simulations
  

- Fix: When saving simulation results, convert list from `update_stats` and `sweep_stats` into numpy arrays.
  This can significantly reduce saving time and the size of the resulting hdf5 file - we have seen the size go down from 30MB to 700kB, when no psi and environment were saved!
